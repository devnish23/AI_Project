Prompt: i want a code for ai agent to instact my desktop and do healthcheck report and send it to my gmail
Output:
Here's an example of a Python script that uses the Google Cloud AI Platform Client Library to create an AI agent that performs a health check on your desktop, generates a report, and sends it to your Gmail:

**Prerequisites**

* Install the required libraries: `google-cloud-aiplatform`, `google-auth`, `google-auth-oauthlib`, `smtplib`
* Create a Google Cloud account and enable the Cloud AI Platform API
* Set up OAuth 2.0 credentials for your Gmail account

**Code**
```python
import os
import json
from google.cloud import aiplatform
from google.oauth2 import service_account
from google.auth_oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart

# Set up credentials for AI Platform and Gmail
AI_PLATFORM_CREDENTIALS = 'path/to/ai-platform-credentials.json'
GMAIL_CREDENTIALS = 'path/to/gmail-credentials.json'

def create_agent():
    # Create an AI agent client
    client = aiplatform AgentsServiceClient()

    return client

def perform_health_check(client):
    # Perform health check on desktop
    print("Performing health check...")
    # Add your custom health check logic here
    pass

def generate_report(results):
    # Generate report from health check results
    report = []
    for result in results:
        report.append({
            'component': result.component,
            'status': result.status
        })
    return json.dumps(report)

def send_email(service, subject, body):
    # Send email to Gmail
    print("Sending email...")
    msg = MIMEMultipart()
    msg['Subject'] = subject
    msg['From'] = 'your-email@gmail.com'
    msg['To'] = 'recipient-email@gmail.com'
    msg.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))
    service.users().messages().send(userId='me', body={'raw': msg.as_string()}).execute()

def main():
    # Create an AI agent client
    client = create_agent()

    # Perform health check and generate report
    results = perform_health_check(client)
    report = generate_report(results)

    # Send email with report
    service = build('gmail', 'v1')
    subject = 'Health Check Report'
    body = report
    send_email(service, subject, body)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
**Explanation**

This code creates an AI agent client using the `google-cloud-aiplatform` library. The `perform_health_check` function is where you'll add your custom health check logic. After performing the health check, it generates a report from the results using the `generate_report` function. Finally, it sends the email with the report to your Gmail address using the `smtplib` and `email.mime` libraries.

**Note**

* You'll need to replace `'path/to/ai-platform-credentials.json'` and `'path/to/gmail-credentials.json'` with the actual paths to your AI Platform credentials and Gmail credentials, respectively.
* You'll also need to modify the `perform_health_check` function to suit your specific health check requirements.
* This code assumes that you have a Google Cloud account and have enabled the Cloud AI Platform API. If you haven't done so already, follow the instructions on the [Google Cloud website](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/docs/how-to/get-started) to get started.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
